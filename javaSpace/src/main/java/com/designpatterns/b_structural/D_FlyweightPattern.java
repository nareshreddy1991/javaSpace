/*
Flyweight: -- caching objects
This pattern is used to reduce the memory footprint. It can also improve performance in applications where object instantiation is expensive.
Simply put, the flyweight pattern is based on a factory which recycles created objects by storing them after creation. Each time an object is requested,
 the factory looks up the object in order to check if it's already been created. If it has, the existing object is returned â€“ otherwise, a new one is created,
 stored and then returned.
The flyweight object's state is made up of an invariant component shared with other similar objects (intrinsic) and a variant component which can be manipulated by the client code (extrinsic).
TODO It's very important that the flyweight objects are immutable: any operation on the state must be performed by the factory.

UseCase:
Data Compression
Data Caching
