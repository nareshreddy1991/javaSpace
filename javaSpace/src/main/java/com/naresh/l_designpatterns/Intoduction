Design Patterns:
    A design pattern provides a general reusable solution for the common problems that occur in software design.
    The pattern typically shows relationships and interactions between classes or objects.
     Design patterns are programming language independent
Type of Design Pattern:
    A) Core Java (or JSE) Design Patterns.
        1. Creational Design Pattern - These design patterns are all about class instantiation or object creation.
            Factory Pattern
            Abstract Factory Pattern
            Singleton Pattern
            Prototype Pattern
            Builder Pattern.
        2. Structural Design Pattern -These design patterns are about organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality
            Adapter Pattern
            Bridge Pattern
            Composite Pattern
            Decorator Pattern
            Facade Pattern
            Flyweight Pattern
            Proxy Pattern
        3. Behavioral Design Pattern - Behavioral patterns are about identifying common communication patterns between objects and realizing these patterns
            Chain Of Responsibility Pattern
            Command Pattern
            Interpreter Pattern
            Iterator Pattern
            Mediator Pattern
            Memento Pattern
            Observer Pattern
            State Pattern
            Strategy Pattern
            Template Pattern
            Visitor Pattern
    b) JEE Design Patterns.
