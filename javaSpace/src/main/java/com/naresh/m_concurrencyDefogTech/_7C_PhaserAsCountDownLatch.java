/*
Phaserâ€™s primary purpose is to enable synchronization of threads that represent one or more phases of activity.
 It lets us define a synchronization object that waits until a specific phase has been completed.
 It then advances to the next phase until that phase concludes. It can also be used to synchronize a single phase, and in that regard, it acts much like a CyclicBarrier.
 Phaser = CountDownlatch + CyclicBarrier + more flexibility
